# Four-in-a-Row Console Game

## Project Description
This C# project is an implementation of the classic "Four-in-a-Row" game in a console application. The project is structured into two main parts: `FourInARowLogic` and `FourInARowUserInterface`. It demonstrates advanced concepts in C# programming, including object-oriented design, separation of concerns, and user interface management.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: The game logic and user interface are separated into different classes, emphasizing encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance.
- **Game Logic Implementation**: In `FourInARowLogic`, the game's core functionalities like the game board (`Board.cs`) and player actions (`Player.cs`) are implemented.
- **User Interface Management**: `FourInARowUserInterface` handles the interaction with the user, including input handling and display outputs (`ConsolePrinter.cs`, `GameManager.cs`).
- **Solution Management**: The project is organized into a solution file (`FourInARow.sln`), showcasing how to manage multi-project solutions in Visual Studio.

## Prerequisites
- Microsoft Visual Studio.
- Basic understanding of C# and .NET Framework.
- Familiarity with console applications in C#.

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the solution file (`FourInARow.sln`) in Visual Studio.
3. Ensure all necessary NuGet packages are restored.
4. Build and run the solution.

## Playing the Game
- Start the application from Visual Studio.
- Follow on-screen instructions to set up the game (e.g., board size, player vs. computer or two players).
- Play the game by choosing columns to drop your coin into.
- The game ends when a player aligns four coins in a row or the board is full.
